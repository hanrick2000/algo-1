#### 1. (560). Subarray Sum Equals K

Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

Example 1:
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```python
class Solution:  
# Let's remember count[V], the number of previous prefix sums with value V. If our newest prefix sum has value W, and W-V == K, then we add count[V] to our answer.

# This is because at time t, A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[t-1] = W, and there are count[V] indices j with j < t-1 and A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[j] = V. Thus, there are count[V] subarrays A[j+1] + A[j+2] + ... + A[t-1] = K.

    def subarraySum(self, A, K):
        count = collections.Counter()
        count[0] = 1
        ans = su = 0
        for x in A:
            su += x
            ans += count[su-K]
            count[su] += 1
        return ans
```
#### (287). Find the Duplicate Number
Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3

>This solution is based on binary search.

>At first the search space is numbers between 1 to n. Each time I select a number mid (which is the one in the middle) and count all the numbers equal to or less than mid. Then if the count is more than mid, the search space will be [1 mid] otherwise [mid+1 n]. I do this until search space is only one number.

>Let's say n=10 and I select mid=5. Then I count all the numbers in the array which are less than equal mid. If the there are more than 5 numbers that are less than 5, then by Pigeonhole Principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle) one of them has occurred more than once. So I shrink the search space from [1 10] to [1 5]. Otherwise the duplicate number is in the second half so for the next step the search space would be [6 10].
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findDuplicate(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        low = 1
        high = len(nums)-1
        
        while low < high:
            mid = low+(high-low)/2
            count = 0
            for i in nums:
                if i <= mid:
                    count+=1
            if count <= mid:
                low = mid+1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
```

#### (424). Longest Repeating Character Replacement

Given a string s that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most k operations on that string.

In one operation, you can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.

Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

Note:
Both the string's length and k will not exceed 104.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "ABAB", k = 2

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

>Re: [Sliding window](similar to finding longest substring with k distinct characters)

>Similar idea in Python but allowing any character, not just uppercase English letters [Updated based on comments below]:
```python
def characterReplacement(self, s, k):
    res = lo = hi = 0
    counts = collections.Counter()
    for hi in range(1, len(s)+1):
        counts[s[hi-1]] += 1
        max_char_n = counts.most_common(1)[0][1]
        if hi - lo - max_char_n > k:
            counts[s[lo]] -= 1
            lo += 1
    return hi - lo
```
[Original code in order to understand comment from @StefanPochmann was:]
```python
def characterReplacement(self, s, k):
    res = lo = 0
    counts = collections.Counter()
    for hi in range(len(s)):
        counts[s[hi]] += 1
        max_char_n = counts.most_common(1)[0][1]
        while (hi - lo - max_char_n + 1 > k):
            counts[s[lo]] -= 1
            lo += 1
        res = max(res, hi - lo + 1)
    return res
```

#### 662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some nodes are null.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

解题关键在满秩树，x的left：2x+1， right： 2x+2。
BFS，在队列中每个node加flag：idx -- 在满秩树中位置
则for each level, width = right - left +1,
keep (max width) updated as BFS

```python
class Solution:
    def widthOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        q = collections.deque([(root,0)])
        max_width = 1
        while q:
            # lv
            left_pos = 0
            for i in range(len(q)):
                node,idx = q.popleft()
                if node.left:
                    q.append((node.left ,idx * 2 + 1))
                if node.right:
                    q.append((node.right,idx * 2 + 2))
                if i == 0:
                    left_pos = idx
            max_width = max(max_width,idx-left_pos+1)
        
        return max_width
```

#### (131). Palindrome Partitioning

Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

Example:

Input: "aab"
Output:
[
  ["aa","b"],
  ["a","a","b"]
]
```python
class Solution(object):
    def partition(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
        """
        out = []
        def isPalindrome(st):
            return st == st[::-1]
        
        def dfs(curr=[], index=1):
            if index == len(s) + 1:
                out.append(list(curr))
                return
            for i in range(index, len(s)+1):
                if isPalindrome(s[index-1:i]):
                    curr.append(s[index-1:i])
                    dfs(curr, i+1)
                    curr.pop()
        dfs()
        return out
```
